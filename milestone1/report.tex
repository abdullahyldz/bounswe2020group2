    \subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Getflix is an online commerce platform that helps users find a plethora
of products they need and purchase them in an easy and straightforward
way. Getflix removes the friction of the shopping experience by
providing an easy-to-use interface on all major desktop and mobile
platforms. Shoppers are able to find products with the means of semantic
search, view product details and decide whether a product is worth it by
reading comments by verified buyers. When their shopping cart is
finalized, they can easily buy their products with debit/credit card.
Getflix also gives the opportunity for buyers to track price changes so
that they can strike better deals.

In Getflix there are four types of users: Guest, Customer, Vendor and
Admins. Guest users are allowed to do basic operations such as searching
products and viewing their details, as well as add products to their
shopping cart. Customers are registered users that are allowed to
continue with checking out process. They can also track their orders,
ask for support from Admins and comment on products they have purchases.
Vendors are allowed to setup an online shop where they can present their
products on our platform. Admins maintain the system and make sure that
operations go smoothly.

\hypertarget{what-we-have-done-so-far}{%
    \subsection{What we have done so far}\label{what-we-have-done-so-far}}

The very first thing we did was, naturally, to get to know each other.
We learned about each other's background, exchanged contact informations
and started building the infrastructure necessary for future work
together. During the first week, we setup our Github repo, agreed on a
communication plan, created a Slack workspace where realtime
communication could happen. Each one of us researched about how to use
github, picked a favorite repository and explained what we liked about
it.

Every week we would meet and discuss the assigned tasks. The major task
we first accomplished was creating a requirements document based on the
customer's needs. This required multiple meetings, both within our team,
as well as with the customer in order to better understand their needs
and remove any ambiguities from the requirements.

Once the requirements were reviewed and finalized, we started working on
a more visual documentation. We prepared three scenarios based on three
personas which describe the archetypes of users we are expecting to see
on our platform. For each user scenario, we prepared a mockup that shows
how that user would be able to achieve his/her end goal on our platform.
Mockups are a series of images, either on our desktop or mobile app,
that shows how the user interacts with our platform to achieve the
desired effect.

The next step was to create three detailed diagrams: Use case diagrams,
Class Diagrams, and Sequence diagrams. These diagrams help clarify the
technical aspect of the platform. It fleshes out the use cases, the
potential classes (in the object-oriented sense) we might use during
implementation. This brings our overview of the system to a more
concrete level.

In the final week, we took the time to produce a project plan that
encompasses what we have done so far as well as a best guess estimation
of the tasks we will have to do in the next course. This is materialized
in the project plan and the RAM (Responsiblity Assignment Matrix)

\hypertarget{future-work}{%
    \subsection{Future work}\label{future-work}}

In the next few weeks, we will practicing together as a team by
implementing an API that could be used on this project. We will learn
how to use git in a team setting, how to write good tests to make sure
our code works as expected, and how to use AWS tools (EC2 for instance)
in order to deploy our app in a production environment. Things take
time, but we are perseverant and patient.

\hypertarget{requirements}{%
    \subsection{Requirements}\label{requirements}}

Requirements is arguably one of the most important parts in the project
because it defines the project as a whole and it guides the direction a
group is heading towards with their project. Documents such as class
diagrams, sequence diagrams and use-case diagrams rely heavily on having
a well-prepared requirements. As a group requirements was the one of the
first things we prepared and it turned out to be quite useful in any
situation where we needed to look up for a functionality of our project.
Also having requirements is a must in terms of establishing a healthy
communication with the customer.

\hypertarget{communication-plan}{%
    \subsection{Communication Plan}\label{communication-plan}}

Communication Plan plays a very crucial part in communication between
group members. Without a communication plan it is impossible to
establish healthy interactions between team members because
communication plan defines the mediums of interaction and guides group
members to use those mediums according to the written purpose in the
plan. Moreover communication plan also brings attention to communication
and forces group members to think and reflect on how to establish
communication in the group. Therefore communication plan brings full
attention to communication and thus it maximizes the possibility of
success. Our group have prepared a communication plan at the beginning
of the semester and ever since it played a huge role on communication
between group members and also with customer.

\hypertarget{user-scenarios-and-mockups}{%
    \subsection{User Scenarios and
        Mockups}\label{user-scenarios-and-mockups}}

User scenarios should be real-life examples, understandable by everyone
and show different kinds of people with various wishes in order to prove
the usability and globality of the platform. We wrote three user
scenarios which are tracking, purchasing and searching. We clearly
identified the personal background of different users, what the users
want, the preconditions, goals and acceptance criterias for these
scenarios from the requirements. Thinking of the actions step by step
for the scenarios helped us to come up with new design and feature ideas
for our platform which will help users to use the platform in a more
efficient way.

Mockups should be realistic, demonstrate the needed functionalities for
specific scenarios and show all the steps of the users from the
scenarios on the platform clearly. We created two web mockups and one
mobile mockup for three scenarios we wrote. We paid attention to make
all these three mockups look compatible with each other. Creating
mockups helped us to test the usability of the platform. Additionally,
as when writing scenarios, it helped us to come up with new design and
feature ideas, because it really facilitates to visualize the platform
and see our abstract ideas in a clear way.

\hypertarget{use-case-diagram}{%
    \subsection{Use-Case Diagram}\label{use-case-diagram}}

The purpose of the Use-Case Diagram is to show the dynamic view of the
system that is the users, the cases and the relationships among them. It
is fundamentally designed considering the requirements of the project.
In our Use-Case Diagram, we have 4 types of user Guest, namely the
unregistered user, and Customer, Vendor and Admin which are registered
users. The basic relationship among them is that registered users can do
anything the Guest can do other than registering since they already did.

\hypertarget{class-diagram}{%
    \subsection{Class Diagram}\label{class-diagram}}

A class diagram~identifies the structure of a system by showing the
system's classes, their attributes, operations, and the relation among
objects. It models which classes are able to communicate with which and
how ,what object we must implement, what behaviors an object is able to
do and what information an object must know and manipulate in both
convenient and compact way. It can be seen as a visual representation of
our requirements. Furthermore, the design of a good class diagram also
affects sequence diagrams. Therefore, we attach an importance of our
class diagram to be comprehensive in order to not limit our feature
works. There are 29 classes and 3 enumerations in our class diagram.
User hierarchy is included and all systems are separated into
controllers. Authentication and authorization system check permissions
of end users determined in requirements. Classes called SearchEngine and
RecommenderSystem implements the current technology to our project.

\hypertarget{sequence-diagram}{%
    \subsection{Sequence Diagram}\label{sequence-diagram}}

We have created 10 sequence diagrams to show how and which classes
interact in our application. Use cases to show in sequence diagrams are
selected carefully considering selecting key use cases of our
applicaton. All possible outcomes of these use cases are shown with
detail in sequence diagrams. Our sequence diagrams clearly show
interaction between various classes in chosen key use cases.

\hypertarget{project-plan}{%
    \subsection{Project Plan}\label{project-plan}}

Creating a high level project plan that outlines the major activities
and milestones helps us in a way that tracking our progress with our
plan. The aim of the plan is to provide the work by estimating the
effort and resources needed to complete the tasks and to compare the
execution. Also in this way, we are able to evaluate how we are
progressing. On the other hand, it helps to answer these kind of
questions:Where are we now according to plan? Where actually should we
be in our project according to plan? Is there any difference and if it
is, how to make up the difference?

\hypertarget{responsibility-assignment-matrix}{%
    \subsection{Responsibility Assignment
        Matrix}\label{responsibility-assignment-matrix}}

Responsibility assignment matrix is an efficient way to show all the
contributions made by each group member on each task of the project. It
is also very helpful while making new task distributions for next tasks
by examining the matrix and realizing whether a member took too much or
too few responsibilities. For a matrix to be well prepared, much
attention should be paid to identifying and defining the roles well by
examining the tasks and what is done so far. We created our matrix with
four roles which are lead, support, reviewer and contributor, and
defined these roles clearly. We paid attention to make it look
compatible with project plan and Gantt chart. Since we continue to
develop our project, our matrix will be also updated with new tasks and
new responsibilities. Although we also identified future tasks and
showed them both in Gantt chart and responsibility assignment matrix,
they are open to change with changes in our task distribution or
assignments we should do.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.3in]{./images/3.jpg}
\end{figure}

\emph{ProjectLibre} is a free open-source project management software
that helped me prepare the project plan as a Gantt chart. The desktop
version is unfortunately very dated and buggy. There was no way to
import the excel data containing the
\texttt{task\_name,\ start\_date,\ end\_date,\ duration,\ predecessors,\ assignees}
of the project plan. It was also very finnicky to use, where errors are
silent, behaviour unpredictable. I tried hacking away around its
limitations, by for example imitating its copy \& paste of the rows with
more or less success. It also had nasty bugs where changing a cell of a
row would for some reason also change the duration of a cell somewhere.
This had me check each duration, and I found that almost 70\% of them
had changed value as I was updated the assignees column. The export to
PDF also had its issues, notably the bad support of Turkish diacritics.

\emph{ProjectLibre} did its job, but gave me headaches personally. I
wouldn't recommend to use it in the future. Other solutions should be
researched

\hypertarget{lucidchart-reviewed-by-aleyna-kara}{%

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[height=0.3in]{./images/4.jpg}
\end{figure}

I have used Lucidchart to create the
design of class diagram which includes functions, variables and classes
of our project as an object oriented manner. Lucidchart has quick user
interface and~large amount of shapes and icons to be used in diagrams.
On the other hand, you can use objects up to 60 and not be able to get
much space to save documents if you don't upgrade to a paid account.

\hypertarget{balsamiq-reviewed-by-aleyna-kara}{%

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.5in]{./images/5.jpg}
\end{figure}

I have used Balsamiq to create designs of mockups that share the idea of
a design to stakeholders without presenting a completed design. It
supports a wide range of prototypes from web prototyping to mobile UI
prototyping. Since it is easy to use, one does not need to be a design
expert to create wireframes using Balsamiq.

\hypertarget{zoom-and-slack-reviewed-by-furkan-nane}{%
    \subsection{Zoom and Slack (Reviewed by Furkan
        Nane)}\label{zoom-and-slack-reviewed-by-furkan-nane}}

Zoom and Slack are a part of the communication plan and they have been
used heavily to communicate by our group members. Zoom is quite useful
at conducting online meetings and it definitely helped our group to
communicate faster than texting during covid-19 lockdown. Slack is a
texting tool that offers a bunch of useful tools and it fits very nicely
into group projects.

\hypertarget{excel-reviewed-by-aslux131-aykan}{%

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.5in]{./images/6.jpg}
\end{figure}

I have used Excel to create the responsibility assignment matrix. Excel
is a popular spreadsheet program which is developed by Microsoft and
part of the Microsoft Office. Because it is intended for everyone to
benefit easily, it's really easy to learn to organize, sort and filter
data in rows and columns, and also to create charts\&graphs. With the
help of this program, I have easily divided the tasks into subgroups and
used different colors for different types of responsibilities. As we
continue to develop our project, I will continue to use Excel for
updating the RAM with new tasks and weekly task distribution.

I have researched Github, markdown syntax and repository,namely Flutter. After my research, I have created my personal wiki page. Since my job was the revision of requirements, I have researched requirement engineering and then written important parts on my own words as a wiki page for better understanding at the second week. Then, I have styled requirements page with HTML. I have both added and changed some parts,e.g. catagory names, definitions in glossary. Then, I have designed searching mock up. After that, I have created tracking mock up due to the feedback and my experience with Balsamiq. Also, I have edited meeting notes like adding numbers of issues after same feedback. I have determined almost all classes, variables and functions of class diagram and then organized into a class diagram using LucidChart. Furthermore, I have contributed the design part of the project as creating four sequence diagrams. I have been contact with Aslı Aykan to help her to integrate our project as a new team member. Then, we created RAM with Aslı Aykan. I have reviewed not only issues but also all commits of my teammates in order to be fair. In addition, I have designed our new logo. Also, I am one of the person who cares the look of our wiki pages. So, I have tried to stay our wiki pages up-to-date adding some gifs etc. Last, I have written not only the evaluation part of class diagram but also review about Balsamiq and Lucidchart in Milestone 1 Report. \\ \midrule
